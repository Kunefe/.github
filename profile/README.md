## What is Kunefe SKS?

Kunefe SKS is a project that we developed for our university project. It is a web application that allows users to create and manage clubs, events, and announcements. Users can also join clubs and events, and they can see the announcements of the clubs they are a member of.

## Preview

Also, please consider that the project has two version: static and dynamic. In static version, you can see the design of the project with dummy data.
